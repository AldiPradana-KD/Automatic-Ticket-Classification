# ðŸš€ Automatic Ticket Classification Project ðŸŽ«

## Overview
Welcome to the **Automatic Ticket Classification** repository! This project focuses on processing customer complaint data using powerful tools like pandas for data manipulation and text preprocessing techniques to clean and normalize complaint text. The `tqdm` library is utilized to provide progress bars for efficient tracking of text processing tasks. In addition, this project covers topics related to **matplotlib, neural networks, natural language processing (NLP), numpy, pandas, Python 3, scikit-learn, seaborn, TensorFlow, tqdm, and wordcloud**.

## Tools and Libraries
The project utilizes various tools and libraries to streamline the process of customer ticket classification and text preprocessing:
- **Pandas:** Used for efficient data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** Employed for data visualization purposes.
- **NumPy:** Essential for numerical computing and array manipulation.
- **scikit-learn:** A powerful machine learning library for implementing classification models.
- **TensorFlow:** Utilized for neural network model implementation.
- **tqdm:** Provides progress bars for easy tracking of text processing tasks.
- **Wordcloud:** Used for generating word clouds to visualize common words in the complaint text.

## Data Processing
The repository's primary focus is on text preprocessing techniques applied to customer complaint data. This involves steps such as:
1. **Data Loading:** Loading the customer complaint data from the provided CSV file.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Removing any unnecessary characters, symbols, or noise from the complaint text.
3. **Text Normalization:** Applying techniques like lemmatization to standardize the text data.
4. **Tokenization:** Breaking down the text into individual tokens for analysis.
5. **Vectorization:** Converting text data into numerical format for machine learning model implementation.

## Model Implementation
In addition to text preprocessing, the project also delves into model implementation for ticket classification. This involves:
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating relevant features from the preprocessed text data.
- **Model Selection:** Choosing an appropriate classification model based on the nature of the data.
- **Training and Evaluation:** Training the model on the processed data and evaluating its performance.
- **Prediction:** Making predictions on new customer complaints to classify them into relevant categories.
